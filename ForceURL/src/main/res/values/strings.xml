    <string name="cHelper_description">"Some apps will ignore the URL received (mainly chromium in incognito), this compatibility layer helps make it more manageable, but it is not a silver bullet.

Currently we have 3 modes and all require help from the user. The URL will be temporarily stored in the clipboard, while we are borrowing the clipboard the user is expected to paste the URL in the search bar and then we will stop borrowing the clipboard.
We always respect what you had in the clipboard before borrowing it, we will restore it later. We also try to respect if you copy something before regaining the clipboard, however for this to work we need to be able to read the clipboard, which is not easy to do in Android 10 or more, for this we need drawing permissions.
-'URLHelper Mode': 4 modes
    -'None': Disabled, incognito firefox will still work, as it accepts URL in incognito.
    -'Automatic': The clipboard content will be restored after a set amount of time (customizable).
    -'Manual': Needs drawing permissions. A bubble will appear, and we will restore the clipboard contents only when tapped.
    -'Semiautomatic': Needs drawing permissions. A combination of automatic and manual, whichever event triggers first.
-'Clipboard borrowing time': For automatic and semiautomatic. The time in seconds before restoring the clipboard content
-'Read for changes…': When disabled, we will not respect what you copy to the clipboard before restoring its contents, but we don't need drawing permissions either

Currently supports: Chromium(chrome, brave,…)"</string>
